# Advent of Code 2025

I will only do the problems that I feel like doing

I will only work on this when I feel like it & solutions will be rather gross

```shell
uv init
uv sync --python 3.12
```

For Rust

```shell
cargo run -p day01

# or

rustc main.rs -o day01 && ./day01
```

to rebuild the Cargo.lock file run

```shell
cargo build
```

> [!NOTE]  
> We should only include our solution .py script and nothing more
